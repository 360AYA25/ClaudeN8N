## Overview
Launch the multi-agent system to create, modify, or fix n8n workflows.

## Usage

### Basic
```
/orch Create a webhook that saves data to Supabase
```

### With Parameters
```
/orch goal="Telegram bot" services="telegram,supabase" workflow_id="abc"
```

### Test Mode
```
/orch --test              # Test all agents
/orch --test agent:builder  # Test specific agent
/orch --test e2e          # End-to-End production test (20+ nodes)
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Values | Default | Description |
|-----------|--------|---------|-------------|
| `goal` | string | (from prompt) | Task description |
| `services` | comma-separated | (auto-detect) | Services to integrate |
| `workflow_id` | string | null | Existing workflow to modify |

## Execution Protocol

### Calling Agents

```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT:
Task({ agent: "architect", prompt: "Clarify requirements..." })

// ❌ WRONG (don't use subagent_type for custom agents!):
Task({ subagent_type: "architect", prompt: "..." })
```

### Agent Delegation

| Stage | Agent | Model |
|-------|-------|-------|
| clarification | architect | sonnet |
| research | researcher | sonnet |
| decision | architect | sonnet |
| credentials | researcher | sonnet |
| implementation | researcher | sonnet |
| build | builder | opus 4.5 |
| validate/test | qa | sonnet |
| analysis | analyst | sonnet |

### Context Passing

1. **In prompt**: Pass ONLY summary (not full JSON!)
2. **Agent reads**: `memory/run_state.json` for details
3. **Agent writes**: Results to run_state + `memory/agent_results/`
4. **Return**: Summary only (~500 tokens max)

### Context Isolation

Each `Task({ agent: "..." })` = **NEW PROCESS**:
- Clean context (~30-75K tokens)
- Model from agent's frontmatter
- Tools from agent's frontmatter
- Contexts do NOT overlap — exchange via files!

### Algorithm

1. Read `memory/run_state.json` or initialize new
2. Check stage, delegate to agent:
   - `clarification` → architect
   - `research` → researcher
   - `decision` → architect
   - `implementation` → researcher
   - `build` → builder
   - `validate/test` → qa
3. Receive updated run_state
4. Advance stage based on output

### Hard Rules

- **NEVER** mutate workflows (only list/get)
- **ALWAYS** advance stage forward (never rollback)
- **ALWAYS** fill `worklog` and `agent_log`

### Output Formats

- **worklog**: `{ ts, cycle, agent, action, outcome }`
- **agent_log**: `{ ts, agent, action, details }`

## 5-PHASE FLOW (Unified)

**No complexity detection!** All requests follow the same flow:

```
PHASE 1: CLARIFICATION
├── User request → Architect
├── Architect ←→ User (диалог)
└── Output: requirements

PHASE 2: RESEARCH
├── Architect → Orchestrator → Researcher
├── Search: local → existing → templates → nodes
└── Output: research_findings (fit_score, popularity)

PHASE 3: DECISION + CREDENTIALS
├── Researcher → Orchestrator → Architect
├── Architect ←→ User (выбор варианта)
├── Orchestrator → Researcher (discover credentials)
├── Researcher → Orchestrator (credentials_discovered)
├── Orchestrator → Architect (present credentials)
├── Architect ←→ User (select credentials)
├── Modify existing > Build new
└── Output: decision + blueprint + credentials_selected

PHASE 4: IMPLEMENTATION
├── Architect → Orchestrator → Researcher (deep dive)
├── Study: learnings → patterns → node configs
└── Output: build_guidance (gotchas, configs, warnings)

PHASE 5: BUILD
├── Researcher → Orchestrator → Builder → QA
├── QA Loop: max 3 cycles, then blocked
└── Output: completed workflow
```

## Session Start

When `/orch` is invoked:

1. **Initialize or load run_state**
   ```
   Read memory/run_state.json
   If empty or finalized → create new with UUID
   ```

2. **Parse user request**
   ```
   Extract: goal, services, constraints
   Set: stage="clarification", cycle_count=0
   ```

3. **Start Architect for clarification**
   ```
   Task(agent=architect, prompt="Clarify requirements with user")
   ```

## Context Passed to Agents

Each agent receives full `run_state`:
- `id`, `user_request`, `goal`
- `stage`, `cycle_count`
- `requirements` (from Architect Phase 1)
- `research_request` (from Architect Phase 2)
- `research_findings` (from Researcher)
- `decision` (from Architect Phase 3)
- `blueprint` (from Architect Phase 3)
- `credentials_discovered` (from Researcher Phase 3 - scanned from existing workflows)
- `credentials_selected` (from Architect Phase 3 - user-chosen credentials)
- `build_guidance` (from Researcher Phase 4 - gotchas, node configs, warnings)
- `workflow` (from Builder)
- `qa_report` (from QA)
- `edit_scope` (nodes to modify)
- `worklog`, `agent_log` (history)

## Stage Transitions

```
clarification → research → decision → implementation → build → validate → test → complete
                                                                    ↓
                                                                 blocked (after 3 QA fails)
```

## QA Loop (max 3 cycles)

```
QA fail → Builder fix (edit_scope) → QA → repeat
After 3 fails → stage="blocked" → report to user
```

## Test Mode

### `--test` (Quick health check)
Tests each agent can be invoked:

| Agent | Test | MCP Tools |
|-------|------|-----------|
| Orchestrator | read run_state | list/get workflows |
| Architect | read files + skills | **NO MCP!** |
| Researcher | search nodes/templates | full search |
| Builder | validate node config | mutations |
| QA | list workflows + executions | testing |
| Analyst | read executions | read-only |

**IMPORTANT:** Architect has NO MCP tools - only Read + Skills!

### `--test e2e` (End-to-End Production Test)

**REAL workflow test** — NOT a mock! Works exactly like normal system.

Follows **standard 5-PHASE FLOW** (no shortcuts):
- Creates REAL 20+ node workflow
- Services: Telegram, Supabase, OpenAI, HTTP
- Auto-discovers and uses real credentials
- Activates, triggers via Chat webhook, verifies execution
- Analyst report at end

**Test workflow:**
- Chat Trigger (dual mode: UI + webhook)
- AI Agent + Supabase + HTTP + Telegram
- Complex logic (IF, Switch, error handling)

**Success:** All nodes executed, services responded, no QA errors, analyst report generated.

**Cleanup:** Deactivate workflow, tag "e2e-test", keep for reference.

### `--test agent:NAME`
Tests specific agent in isolation:
```
/orch --test agent:builder
/orch --test agent:qa
/orch --test agent:researcher
```

## Examples

### Create Simple Workflow
```
/orch Create a webhook that responds with "Hello World"
```

### Create Complex Integration
```
/orch mode=complex goal="Telegram bot that saves messages to Supabase and notifies Slack" services="telegram,supabase,slack"
```

### Fix Existing Workflow
```
/orch workflow_id=abc123 Fix the Supabase insert error
```

### Run Tests
```
/orch --test e2e           # Production-grade 20+ node test
```

## Escalation Levels

| Level | Trigger | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| L1 | Simple error | Builder direct fix |
| L2 | Unknown error | Researcher → Builder |
| L3 | 3+ failures | stage="blocked" |
| L4 | Blocked | Report to user + Analyst post-mortem |

## Output

On completion, run_state contains:
- `workflow.id` - Created/updated workflow ID
- `qa_report.ready_for_deploy` - Whether ready for production
- `worklog` - Full execution history
- `finalized.status` - True when complete
